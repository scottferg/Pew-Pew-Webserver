Pew Pew Webserver

Pew Pew Webserver is a lightweight Python web application framework based loosely on
GetShitDone by Damon Kohler.  Pew Pew apps are self-hosting.

To build an application, create a Python script in your webroot with these basic contents:

import sys

sys.path.append('..')
import PewPewServer

class MyApp(PewPewServer.App):

    def GET_handler(self, params):
        pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    myApp = MyApp('myappname', 80)
    myApp.start()

Any call to 'some/remote/uri' is routed to the function GET_some_remote_uri in your MyApp
class.
